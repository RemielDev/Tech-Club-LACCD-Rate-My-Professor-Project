   ```

3. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner

## Usage

1. **Visit LACCD Course Search**
   - Go to [LACCD Course Search](https://mycollege-guest.laccd.edu/psc/classsearchguest/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/COMMUNITY_ACCESS.CLASS_SEARCH.GBL)
   - Select your campus and search for courses

## How It Works

### Architecture

1. **Content Script** (`content.js`)
   - Runs on LACCD course search pages
   - Detects and extracts professor names from the page
   - Injects rating buttons next to each name

2. **Background Service Worker** (`background.js`)
   - Handles Rate My Professor API requests
   - Caches results to minimize API calls
   - Maps LACCD campuses to RMP school IDs

3. **Rate My Professor Integration**
   - Uses RMP's GraphQL API for professor searches
   - Matches professors by name and school
   - Retrieves ratings, review counts, and would-take-again percentages

### Campus Mapping

The extension maintains accurate mappings between LACCD campuses and their Rate My Professor school IDs:

```javascript
const LACCD_SCHOOLS = {
  'LAPC': 'Los Angeles Pierce College',
  'LACC': 'Los Angeles City College',
  // ... and 7 more campuses
};
```

## Technical Details

### Manifest Version
- Uses Manifest V3 (latest Chrome extension standard)

### Permissions
- `storage`: Cache professor search results
- `host_permissions`: Access LACCD and RMP websites

### Technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript (no external dependencies)
- Chrome Extension APIs
- GraphQL for RMP data

### Caching
- Professor searches are cached for 24 hours
- Reduces API calls and improves performance
- Cache is stored in memory (clears on extension restart)

## Edge Cases Handled

- ‚úÖ Professors listed as "Staff" or "TBA" are ignored
- ‚úÖ New professors without RMP profiles show "Not Found"
- ‚úÖ Name variations (FirstName LastName, LastName FirstName)
- ‚úÖ Titles removed (Dr., Prof., Mr., Ms., Mrs.)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic content loading on page navigation
- ‚úÖ Multiple professors with similar names (best match algorithm)

## Troubleshooting

### Ratings Not Appearing?

1. **Wait a Few Seconds**: Extension needs time to load after page renders
2. **Refresh the Page**: Try reloading the course search results
3. **Check Console**: Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console for error messages
4. **Verify URL**: Make sure you're on the correct LACCD course search page

### "Not Found" for Known Professors?

- Professor might be new and not yet on Rate My Professor
- Name might be formatted differently on RMP (check manually)
- Professor might teach at a different campus on RMP

### Extension Not Loading?

1. Check that Developer Mode is enabled
2. Look for errors on `chrome://extensions/` page
3. Try removing and re-adding the extension
4. Ensure all files are present (manifest.json, content.js, background.js, etc.)
